How the current architecture helps you send and receive messages in a secure way inside or outside of your infrastructure.

In this section you will learn more about the following features:

- Connection
- Channels
- Events
- Authentication
- Configuration

## Connection

A connection means that a client connected to the RootSocket servers and it is able to communicate.

There are three actors, first we have a client (device that wants to connect to a WebSocket), a server (your server) and a RootSocket server.

A client won't be able to connect to a WebSocket without a connection token. Every connection token must be created with a key, usually this key is private and
saved in your server.

Connection tokens are valid for a small amount of time (up to 5 minutes) and it can be reused in that time window if for some reason
the client has problems to connect but it won't allow multiple clients to connect with the same token.

After a client connects with a token you will be able to see the connection in your application in real-time.

If you need to create connections from the client directly (<span style={{color: 'red'}}>this will allow anyone to create <b>UNLIMITED CONNECTIONS</b>, we strongly suggest against this option unless it is an internal service and you trust your users</span>) you can make requests to our API endpoint to generate a token with your private key.

  Remember that we do not guarantee a connection to be open for an undefined amount of time, we upgrade servers and
  applications which may disconnect WebSockets.

## Channels

A channel is used to send and receive messages. Anybody subscribed to a channel will be able to receive and send messages to it.

Channel names are limited to alphanumeric characters. This is the exact regular expression we use to verify that a name is valid:

```js
^[a-zA-Z0-9.]{0,100}$
```

## Events

An event is what we call packets of information that travel between a client and a server.

There are multiple type of events but you won't need to know anything about them unless you want to implement your own solution.

Events use JSON to encode information, each event follows a structure and depending on which type we receive it will contain information in different fields:

```json
{
  "event": "<type>",
  "data": {
    "detail": "<errors>",
    "where": "<errors>",
    "channel": "<subscriptions>",
    "raw": "<messages>",
    "auth": "<subscriptions>"
  }
}
```

All event types are listed below, if there is no match for any type it will be considered a message event, this means that it will contain raw data that needs to be
sent to a channel.

```json
["ping", "pong", "subscription-add", "subscription-remove", "disconnect", "error"]
```

<Callout>
  There is a hard size limit for all events at 1MB. Any event with a size above that limit will be dropped.
</Callout>

## Authentication

Subscriptions are authenticated by default but can be disabled. This means that, unless you change the settings of your application, the client will need to send
an authentication token every time it tries to subscribe to a channel.

Each authentication channel should be provided by your server when a client tries to subscribe, this token should be requested before the subscription event is
sent to the RootSocket server.

Our libraries automatically handle this for you.

## Configuration

Each application can have a configuration.

You can enable if a client is able to send events to the RootSocket server, if it is allowed to subscribe to channels or if it needs to authenticate for subscriptions.

You can access this options in your application settings.
